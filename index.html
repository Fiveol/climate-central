  <h1>Climate Change: Understanding Our Changing Planet</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>What Is Climate Change?</h2>
    <p>
      Climate change refers to long-term changes in Earth’s temperature, weather patterns, and climate systems.
      While climate has naturally changed over time, today’s climate change is happening much faster due to
      human activities—especially the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.

    <h2>What Causes Climate Change?</h2>
    <p>
      The primary cause of modern climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
      These gases trap heat and warm the planet.
    </p>

    <h3>Main causes include:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Burning fossil fuels for electricity, transportation, and industry</li>
      <li>Deforestation and land-use changes</li>
      <li>Industrial and agricultural activities</li>
      <li>Excessive waste and pollution</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Key greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O).

    <h2>Effects of Climate Change</h2>
    <p>Climate change affects people, wildlife, and ecosystems across the globe.</p>

    <h3>Major impacts include:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Rising global temperatures</li>
      <li>Melting glaciers and polar ice</li>
      <li>Rising sea levels and coastal flooding</li>
      <li>More frequent and intense heatwaves, storms, droughts, and wildfires</li>
      <li>Threats to food security and water supplies</li>
      <li>Loss of biodiversity and habitats</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why Climate Change Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Climate change affects everyone. It can harm human health, damage economies, and increase inequality—
      especially for communities that are least responsible for causing it. Taking action now can reduce
      future damage and protect the planet for future generations.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>How We Can Reduce Climate Change</h2>
    <p>Everyone has a role to play in reducing climate change.</p>

    <h3>Ways to take action:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use renewable energy like solar and wind</li>
      <li>Save energy at home and school</li>
      <li>Reduce, reuse, and recycle</li>
      <li>Choose public transport, biking, or walking</li>
      <li>Eat more plant-based foods</li>
      <li>Support climate-friendly policies and initiatives</li>
    </ul>

  <section>
    <h2>What You Can Do Today</h2>
    <p>
      Small actions add up. Learn about climate change, talk to others, make sustainable choices, and support
      organizations working to protect the environment.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Our Future Depends on Action</h2>
    <p>
      Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time—but it’s also an opportunity to create a
      cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable world. By working together, we can make a difference.
