Climate Change: Understanding Our Changing Planet
What Is Climate Change?

Climate change refers to long-term changes in Earth’s temperature, weather patterns, and climate systems. While climate has naturally changed over time, today’s climate change is happening much faster due to human activities—especially the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.

What Causes Climate Change?

The primary cause of modern climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and warm the planet.

Main causes include:

Burning fossil fuels for electricity, transportation, and industry

Deforestation and land-use changes

Industrial and agricultural activities

Excessive waste and pollution

Key greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O).

Effects of Climate Change

Climate change affects people, wildlife, and ecosystems across the globe.

Major impacts include:

Rising global temperatures

Melting glaciers and polar ice

Rising sea levels and coastal flooding

More frequent and intense heatwaves, storms, droughts, and wildfires

Threats to food security and water supplies

Loss of biodiversity and habitats

Why Climate Change Matters

Climate change affects everyone. It can harm human health, damage economies, and increase inequality—especially for communities that are least responsible for causing it. Taking action now can reduce future damage and protect the planet for future generations.

How We Can Reduce Climate Change

Everyone has a role to play in reducing climate change.

Ways to take action:

Use renewable energy like solar and wind

Save energy at home and school

Reduce, reuse, and recycle

Choose public transport, biking, or walking

Eat more plant-based foods

Support climate-friendly policies and initiatives

What You Can Do Today

Small actions add up. Learn about climate change, talk to others, make sustainable choices, and support organizations working to protect the environment.

Our Future Depends on Action

Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time—but it’s also an opportunity to create a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable world. By working together, we can make a difference.
